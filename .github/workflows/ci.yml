# CI workflow for Poem of the Day
#
# NOTE: Currently failing due to GitHub Actions environment limitation:
# - Xcode 26.1 RC SDK (23B77) doesn't match available simulator runtimes
# - Available runtimes: iOS 18.4-18.6, iOS 26.0.1 (23A8464)
# - Will work with self-hosted runners or when GitHub updates simulator runtimes
